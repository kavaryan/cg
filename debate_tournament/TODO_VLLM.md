# TODO: Switch to vLLM on Colab with ngrok and GPU Monitoring

## Completed
- [x] Analyze current APIClient using Groq via litellm
- [x] Create Colab notebook for vLLM setup with ngrok and GPU monitoring
- [x] Modify api_client.py to support custom base_url for vLLM server
- [x] Set up ngrok account and get auth token
- [x] Open Colab notebook (colab_vllm_setup.ipynb) in Google Colab
- [x] Replace YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN in the notebook with actual token
- [x] Run all cells in the Colab notebook to start vLLM server and ngrok tunnel (used Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct as 0.5B was not available)
- [x] Note the public URL: https://unsinisterly-bubaline-shonna.ngrok-free.dev/v1
- [x] Set environment variable: export VLLM_BASE_URL=https://unsinisterly-bubaline-shonna.ngrok-free.dev/v1
- [x] Test the local code with the vLLM server - successful response received
- [x] Monitor GPU usage in Colab via nvidia-smi cells

## Notes
- Used Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model (0.5B not available in Colab environment)
- GPU monitoring available via nvidia-smi in Colab
- Keep Colab runtime active for ongoing use
- Integration tested and working
